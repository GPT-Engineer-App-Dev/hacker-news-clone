# hacker-news-clone

Implement the basic page layout for the Hacker News clone with these elements:

- A header with the Hacker News logo and a navigation menu
- The navigation menu should have links to "new", "past", "comments", "ask", "show", "jobs", "submit" 
- The header should also have a "login" button on the right side
- A main content area that will contain the stories list
- A footer with a simple copyright notice 

Use a minimalistic design with a white background, and the official orange Hacker News color for links and buttons.
